# hemispheR-test
Code to implement hemispheR (Francesco Chianucci) quickly on folders of photos.

See https://gitlab.com/fchianucci/hemispheR for details about this incredibly useful LAI photo package! It has saved me (and my undergrads) many many hours of manual processing in other software. 

Chianucci, F. and Macek, M., 2023. hemispheR: an R package for fisheye canopy image analysis. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 336, p.109470.

##Codes
There are only two codes included (1) `LAI_photo_processing.Rmd` an Rmarkdown file that provides a walkthrough of how Chianucci's package works and (2) `lai-batch.R` an additional R file containing functions I wrote to automate the image processing. 

Sample photographs are contained in `samples`. Any additional photos can be added to this repository and the code easily modified.
